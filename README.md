# Traveling Salesman Problem
## Using Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Simulated Anealing

The travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP)
asks the following question:
"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities,
what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"
It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.
